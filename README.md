# Designing systems that survive change.

<br /><br />

I view code as a liability. My goal is to delete as much of it as possible while increasing system stability. I optimize for the poor soul who has to debug this at 3 AM (usually me).

<br /><br />

## Tools I Trust

**When reliability matters**  
TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Git

**In production**  
Next.js, Node.js, Docker

**For refining**  
React, Tailwind CSS

<br /><br />

## Open Source

The best contribution is often a deleted line or a clarified document. I aim to leave every repo cleaner than I found it, prioritizing readable implementations over clever hacks. Code is written for humans first, machines second.

<br /><br />

## Selected Work

**[ReactAtom](https://reactatoms.vercel.app/)**  
The Anti-Library.  
*Why:* To escape dependency chains and npm bloat.  
*Engineering Choice:* Zero-runtime overhead via copy-paste architecture.

**[Zenith Studio](https://zenith-interactive.vercel.app/)**  
Cinematic rendering engine.  
*Why:* Proving the browser can rival native console fidelity.  
*Engineering Choice:* Frame-perfect GSAP timeline management.

**[MacOS Web](https://macbook-landing-inky.vercel.app/)**  
OS emulation environment.  
*Why:* A study in handling complex UI state at scale.  
*Engineering Choice:* Physics-based interaction models with Framer Motion.

## Notes

- Clarity beats cleverness.
- Refactors are investments.
- If you can't explain it, you don't understand it.
