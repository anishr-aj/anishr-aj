### Turning ideas into production-ready systems.

<br />

## Who Am I?
I don't just write code; I dismantle problems. I enjoy breaking systems to understand them and rebuilding them to withstand scale. My focus is on zero-runtime overhead, strict type safety, and architecture that doesn't require constant babysitting.

<br />

## 🛠 Arsenal

| **Daily Drivers** | **In Production** | **Debugging at 3AM** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TypeScript, React, Next.js | Node.js, PostgreSQL, Tailwind | Python, Git Internals, Shell |

<br />

## ⚡ Flagship System

### [ReactAtom](https://reactatoms.vercel.app/)
**The Anti-Library for Modern UIs.**
Most component libraries are bloated cages. ReactAtom is different. It’s an ownership-based system where you copy atomic, accessible, and type-safe components directly into your codebase. No npm dependency hell. Just pure, ownable code.

## 🏗 Featured Deployments

**[Zenith Studio](https://zenith-interactive.vercel.app/)**  
*Why it exists:* To prove that the web can rival native gaming consoles in visual fidelity.  
*Key Tech:* GSAP for timeline management, WebGL for rendering, and optimized LCP/CLS for performance.

**[MacOS Web](https://macbook-landing-inky.vercel.app/)**  
*Why it exists:* A challenge to reproduce a complex OS desktop environment entirely in the browser DOM.  
*Key Tech:* Framer Motion for physics-based interactions and Three.js for 3D spatial awareness.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> **"Complexity is the enemy."**

- **Code Quality:** If it requires a paragraph to explain, it requires a refactor.
- **Maintainability:** I write code for the developer who will inherit it 6 months from now (usually me).
- **Learning:** I optimize for understanding, not just "getting it to work."
